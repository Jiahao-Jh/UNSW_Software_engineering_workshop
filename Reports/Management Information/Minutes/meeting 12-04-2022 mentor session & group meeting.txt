	In mentor session, the mentor talked about how will the D4 demo run and gave us some advices:

	Business value: how do these features provide value, why each feature useful
	Technique point of view: why do we use these tools (such as http, css)
	Conduct a demo practice before actual demo run.

	In the demo, we need to talk corresponding buniess value when each feature demoing (about 1 min for buniess value)
	Also we need to fix the app with the feedback from D3 demo.

	Additionally, about the report, we need to write at least 10 pages and reach as many points as possible.



	In the group discussion, we planned to finish the app first and make it look nice, and then work on the final report.

	Here is the work arrangement for final repot:

	Use Cases, Requirements: Kexin
