In mentor session, everyone aksed about questions about D3 and the mentor went through the spec and then gave us some advice and suggestions on:

	How to build this web application(use webCMS as an example which is functional and easy to use), 

	Use what kind of api to build(one from ours or other teams; may use other api from internet as well), 

	Talked about what kind of feature could we have in the web application(topic about travel, then have 
	features such as search outbreaks in destination, search hotels and flats); 

	Gave some feedback on the scraper of the location and disease searching, 

	Use what kind framework to build the frontend(html and css, bootstrap), 

	User story is optional(but good to see it on ppt), 

	Talk about the time split in presentation(half to half in 'Business Idea and Requirements Addressed' 
	and 'Technical Point of View', and leave time for demo).

In group disscusion, the basic idea is each person do one feature of this web application. Then we brainstorm for some features:

	Search loaction for outbreaks

	If we do the topic travel, then search outbreak in past few days

	Search outbreaks and show it in the global map(optional)

	Predict trends of outbreak

	Some thoughts about medical stock

	Search reports

Found one api could be used:  https://www.disease.sh/


Current thinking on topic: 
	
	about travelling, check destination in this website could get information about outbreak occurred in that place.

Target before next meeting:

	Find more api, 

	Find more ideas about topic

Planed next meeting:

this Saturday or Sunday
