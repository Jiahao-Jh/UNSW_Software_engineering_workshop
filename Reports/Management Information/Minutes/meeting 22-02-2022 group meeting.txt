Content:
	After mentor session, everyone then had another meeting in Wechat to discuss
	Deliverable 1(D1). First, brain storm the content of what should we do in D1 about 
	how to build API, how to develop API, how to build web, services, database, frontend,
	backend and use what kind of language to develop them.

	Then, split the work in D1:
	As Shuhao had already setup the github repository, so we just allocated the work remained.
	Design Details (1): Jiahao Zhang, Haochen Shi
	Design Details (2): Shuhao Hu

	Finally, we decide to finish these tasks roughly before our next meeting, so that
