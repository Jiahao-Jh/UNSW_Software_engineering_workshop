Project Introduction:
After the COVID-19 global pandemic, it raises peopleâ€™s attention on the early detection of infectious disease. The Integrated Systems for Epidemic Response(ISER) at UNSW is a organization that working on this area. The EpiWATCH system they developed using open-source data detected many infectious diseases in very early stage and contribute towards global epidemic response.

In our project, we plan to develop a platform and an API towards our benchmark EpiWATCH system. The API we developed would be able to access by other teams in SENG3011 to find disease reports in CDC.

> Stage 1 is to build an API which will handle requests from users about disease outbreaks from [CDC Websites](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks)
> 
> Stage 2 is to build an Web interface using stage 1 APIs based on our own API or other teams APIs


Python is used to scrape disease articles and reports from [CDC Websites](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks)

AWS API Gateway is used to handle user requests and pass user parameters to python scraper
